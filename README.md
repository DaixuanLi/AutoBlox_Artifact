# AutoBlox_Artifact

Artifact of paper Learning to Drive Software-DeÔ¨Åned Solid-State Drives to appear in MICRO'23.

## Artifact Introduction

AutoBlox is a learning framework to assist the design of Software-Defined SSDs. Specifically, AutoBlox can efficiently identify optimized configurations for target workloads with constraints (Host Interface, Capacity, Power).

## Dependencies Installation 

AutoBlox requires psutil, scikit-learn, numpy and seaborn packages. 

Please run the following script to install dependencies (requires sudo permission).
```
sudo bash cloudlab_server_setup_instructions.sh
```
## Trace Downloading and Installation

Please download the traces from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zbOD10i-iwJHl9947iMd0N5GwmliDewp/view?usp=sharing.

unzip the traces in AutoBlox_Artifact directory:

```
unzip autoblox_traces.zip
```

Then, move all the folders into the root directory:

```
mv autoblox_traces/* .
```

## Running the Experiments

Before running the experiments, you first need to set up the xdb Tables. Download the baseline configuration and the warmup files from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ha25yZPiIT2U_9i3tI9w9uL5oM3fsKbE/view?usp=drive_link

unzip the configurations into the root directory, and setup xdb with it:

```
unzip xdb_base.zip
cd src/
./setup_xdb.sh
```

The xdb directory is automatically set to the root directory of AutoBlox. If you wish to build your own xdb, please change the xdb directory in setup_xdb.sh file. The setup on cloudlab is different, please refer to the cloudlab accunt we provided.

Then, you can start reproducing the figures.

### Workload Clustering (Figure 2)

To reproduce Figure 2 in the paper, please run the following scripts in src/ folder: 

```
python3 clustering_motivaltion.py
cd ../reproduced_dat
python3 clustering.py
```

The workload clustering figure will appear in reproduced_dat folder. This experiment will demonstrate that AutoBlox can efficiently identify new workloads.


### Fine-grained and Coarsed-grained Pruning (Figure 3 and Figure 4)

To reproduce Figure 3 and Figure 4,  please run this in src/ folder:

```
run_pruning.sh -w target_workload
```

Here target_workload has 7 options (YCSB, TPCC, AdspayLoad, MapReduce, LiveMapsBackEnd, WebSearch, and CloudStorage). It takes approximately 2-4 hour for each workload to finish its pruning. To speed up the experiments, we will provide you several CloudLab nodes to run the pruning experiments in parallel.

After the pruning is finished, please run

```
cd reproduced_dat/
python3 fine_grained_pruning.py
python3 coarsed_pruning.py
```

After that,  Figure 3 and Figure 4 will appear in the reproduced_dat folder.

### Learning (reproduce Table 1, Figure 7, and Figure 8)

Give a type of workloads, we will train the models and learn the SSD parameters with and without tuning order respectively, please use the following scripts: 

```
cd src
find_best_conf.py target_workload use_tuning_order xdb_directory
```

Here target_workload has 7 options (YCSB, TPCC, AdspayLoad, MapReduce, LiveMapsBackEnd, WebSearch, and CloudStorage); use_tuning_order has two options (True and False); and xdb_directory is the xdb database used in AutoBlox. Since it will take approximately 18 hour to finish the learning of each workload, we will provide several CloudLab nodes to run the learning in parallel.

After the learning, the experimental results will be placed in the xdb/ folder. 

To reproduce Table 1, please run the following script:

```
python3 get_recommended_configurations.py xdb_directory
```

Table 1 should show up in the reproduced_dat folder. Note that because of the randomness of the ML model, the performance improvement may have less than 10\% deviation.

To plot the learning procedure as shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, pleae run: 

```
python3 profile_training.py xdb_directory
cd ../reproduced_dat
python3 learning_profile.py
python3 tuning_time.py
```

Figure 7 and 8 should appear in reproduce_dat/ folder. This figure shows that with enforced tuning order, AutoBlox can accelerate the training procedure.
